dfog
====

dfog is a code normalization layer for the fog language. Its job is similar to that of a "linker". It renders the fog program using WebKit and then simplifies CSS rules. An example of a rule simplication would be underline, dfog will convert all text with `text-decoration: underline` into text enclosed in `<u>` tags.
